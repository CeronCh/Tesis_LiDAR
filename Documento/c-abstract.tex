This research focused on the evaluation of laser distance sensors for environment mapping applications with mobile robotic agents, emphasizing the importance of precise and reliable sensors for autonomous navigation. Through a comparative analysis of three laser distance sensors: VL53L0X, LiDAR FHL-LD20, and YDLIDAR Tmini Pro, various technical criteria and parameters were assessed, leading to the selection of the LiDAR FHL-LD20 as the most suitable for integration in such applications. Additionally, a software tool was developed to process, visualize, and interpret the data generated by the selected sensor.

The tool not only facilitated data interpretation but also became a key resource for validating the sensor’s performance under different operational conditions. Simultaneously, calibration and characterization tests were carried out in specific scenarios. These tests helped define the sensor's minimum effective measurement range, refine data by filtering out null measurements, and analyze the distributions of distance and angle readings, revealing that the sensor provides precise measurements with deviations of less than 5 mm in distances and a margin of error below 3° in angular measurements.

Finally, the feasibility of integrating the sensor into available mobile robotic agents at the University was assessed. The contributions of this research are significant, as they pave the way for future applications in autonomous robotics and dynamic environment mapping, providing valuable tools to advance the integration of LiDAR sensors into mobile robotic systems.
